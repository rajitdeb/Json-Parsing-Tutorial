# Json-Parsing-Tutorial
A sample app built using Flutter to understand how to effectively and easily parse json alongside integrating `Dio` (for handling http requests), `json_serializable` and `Bloc` (for state management).

## Bloc Flow Diagram:
For the most part, each component inside the project/app will have its own individual bloc component (**event** tree, **state**, **bloc** logic), which will follow the same rule as shown in the diagram below.
